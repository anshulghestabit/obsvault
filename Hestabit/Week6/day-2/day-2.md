# DAY 2 — FEATURE ENGINEERING + FEATURE SELECTION

### Learning Outcomes:
* Create meaningful features
* Encoding strategies
* Feature selection techniques

### Topics
* Categorical encoding
* Numerical feature transformations
* Text vectorization
* Feature selection (Correlation, Mutual Info, RFE)

### Exercise
Build a feature engineering pipeline that:
* Encodes features
* Normalizes features
* Generates 10+ new features
* Applies feature selection

### Deliverables
* `/features/build_features.py`
* `/features/feature_selector.py`
* `FEATURE-ENGINEERING-DOC.md`
