# DAY 3 — MODEL BUILDING + ADVANCED TRAINING PIPELINE

### Learning Outcomes:
* Multi-model training
* Cross-validation
* Overfitting control

### Exercise
Create a unified training pipeline that:
* Trains 4 models (Logistic, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network)
* Performs 5-fold cross-validation
* Outputs metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)

### Deliverables
* `/training/train.py`
* `/models/best_model.pkl`
* `MODEL-COMPARISON.md`
