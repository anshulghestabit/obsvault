# WEEK 6 — MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEERING
(Data Science + Feature Engineering + Model Building + Deployment + Monitoring)

### WEEK 6 OBJECTIVES
Interns will learn:
* Professional ML pipeline architecture
* Clean, modular ML system design
* Advanced feature engineering
* Model optimization + regularization
* Training pipeline orchestration
* Model evaluation + explainability
* Model deployment + monitoring

---

# DAY 1 — DATA PIPELINE + EDA + PROJECT ARCHITECTURE

### Learning Outcomes:
* ML project architecture
* Dataset versioning
* EDA
* Data preprocessing pipelines

### Mandatory Folder Structure (No shortcuts)
```text
src/
  data/
  notebooks/
  features/
  pipelines/
  models/
  training/
  evaluation/
  deployment/
  monitoring/
  utils/
```

### Exercise
Build a **data loader + EDA pipeline** that:
1. Loads dataset
2. Cleans data
3. Creates processed csv
4. Generates EDA report (Correlation, Distributions, Missing values)

### Deliverables
* `/pipelines/data_pipeline.py`
* `/notebooks/EDA.ipynb`
* `DATA-REPORT.md`
